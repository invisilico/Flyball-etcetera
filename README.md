# Flyball

Fly successfully held ball for >1 hour, head tilts seem stochastic.

Fly occasionally took a break to either groom or try to free itself, unsure which.

Interestingly, does not drop the ball. 

(Does it realize it must rely on legs in absence of wings?)

(Does it prefer something to hold over free limbs? object fixation to reduce anxiety? What about flight?)

Tried using a vanity mirror to capture side and top frame together using microscope for detail.

Failed due to mirror depth and angle, need a thin film reflective surface next time.

# Social Behavior observations

Crowded vials have patterns in motion, social spaces are maintained, exceptional amount of control must be required to swarm.

Flies piroutte and go into a frenzy on occasion, difficult to study at constant bitrate encoded video.
